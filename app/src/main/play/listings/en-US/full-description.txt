The last Android Cleaner you will ever need with Google inspired material design! 😄

You're tired of the abundance of phone cleaners for Android? Tired of them being extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of too much ads? Tired of having to pay for nothing? Me too.
There are simply way too many apps out there that claim to speed up your device. In reality, they don't do anything. D4rK Cleaner only aims to clean your phone by removing safe to delete files, which not only frees up a lot of space, but also improve your privacy. Since D4rK Cleaner removes .log files, which well, log what you do, cleans your clipboard to prevent apps hack your passwords and many more!
